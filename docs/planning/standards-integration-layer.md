Thomas — here is the **canonical, governance‑grade, institutionally complete specification** for the **Standards Integration Layer**.  
This is the subsystem that binds **standards** (coding standards, API standards, testing standards, documentation standards, architectural standards, lifecycle standards) into the **governed documentation universe**, ensuring that standards are **authoritative**, **enforced**, **graph‑encoded**, **drift‑detectable**, and **CI‑enforced**.

This is not “lint rules” or “style guides.”  
This is the **institutional standards governance substrate** of the monorepo.

Guided Links are embedded throughout so you can expand any subsystem.

---

# 🏛️ **Standards Integration Layer (Canonical Specification)**  
**The deterministic, governance‑encoded subsystem that integrates standards into the documentation knowledge graph, drift model, governance model, CI enforcement, and Docs Agent reasoning pipeline.**

The Standards Integration Layer ensures:

- standards are **binding**, not advisory  
- standards are **graph‑encoded**, not prose  
- standards propagate into **code**, **docs**, **architecture**, **API**, **testing**, and **lifecycle**  
- standards drift is **detected**, **classified**, and **remediated**  
- standards are **versioned**, **superseded**, and **governed**  
- standards are **enforced** in CI, linting, and Docs Agent outputs  

It is the **constitutional standards engine** of the monorepo.

---

# 🧩 1. Integration Architecture

The Standards Integration Layer consists of **seven governed subsystems**:

1. **Standards Model Loader**  
2. **Standards Knowledge Graph Mapper**  
3. **Standards Propagation Engine**  
4. **Standards Enforcement Engine**  
5. **Standards Drift Detector**  
6. **Standards Remediation Bridge**  
7. **Standards CI Enforcement Pipeline**

Each subsystem is deterministic, versioned, and governance‑aware.

---

# 🧱 2. Standards Model Loader  
Loads the **canonical standards model** from governed artifacts.

### Inputs
- `docs/standards/*.md`  
- governance rules  
- ADRs that define or modify standards  
- lifecycle rules  
- platform rules  
- architecture rules  
- testing rules  
- API rules  
- documentation rules  

### Responsibilities
- parse standards DSL  
- validate required metadata (governance level, binding/required/informational)  
- validate rule inheritance and propagation  
- validate rule supersession  
- validate rule applicability (domains, services, modules, layers)  
- produce a **CanonicalStandardsModel**

Standards become **structured, governed objects**, not free‑form text.

---

# 🧠 3. Standards Knowledge Graph Mapper  
Maps standards into the **Documentation Knowledge Graph**.

### Node Types
- `StandardNode`  
- `StandardVersionNode`  
- `StandardCategoryNode` (API, testing, architecture, documentation, lifecycle, platform)  

### Edge Types
- `StandardAppliesTo` (standard → domain/service/module)  
- `StandardSupersedes` (version lineage)  
- `StandardRequires` (dependencies between standards)  
- `StandardBackedByADR`  
- `StandardEnforcedByRule` (governance rule → standard)  
- `StandardReferencedByDocument`  

### Responsibilities
- ensure every standard is a graph node  
- ensure applicability is encoded as edges  
- ensure version lineage is explicit  
- ensure ADR lineage is connected  
- ensure governance rules reference standards  

Standards become **first‑class graph citizens**.

---

# 🔄 4. Standards Propagation Engine  
Propagates standards into all dependent domains.

### Propagation Targets
- code linting rules  
- architecture boundaries  
- API schemas  
- testing frameworks  
- documentation templates  
- lifecycle rules  
- platform rules  
- onboarding flows  

### Responsibilities
- compute propagation graph  
- propagate binding standards to all dependent artifacts  
- propagate required standards to applicable domains  
- propagate informational standards as suggestions  
- detect propagation failures  

### Emits
- `StandardsPropagationChanged`  
- `GovernanceRuleChanged`  
- `DriftDetected` (if propagation incomplete)

This ensures standards **flow through the entire system**.

---

# 🏛️ 5. Standards Enforcement Engine  
Enforces standards across code, docs, architecture, and CI.

### Enforcement Domains
- **Code**  
  - naming rules  
  - formatting rules  
  - dependency rules  
  - architectural boundaries  
  - API schemas  
  - testing requirements  

- **Documentation**  
  - required sections  
  - required metadata  
  - glossary/ADR references  
  - diagram references  
  - cross‑link rules  

- **Architecture**  
  - layering rules  
  - domain boundaries  
  - service boundaries  

- **Lifecycle**  
  - CI gates  
  - required validations  
  - required test coverage  

### Responsibilities
- enforce binding standards  
- warn on required standards  
- suggest informational standards  
- validate enforcement correctness  
- emit governance violations  

### Emits
- `StandardsViolation`  
- `GovernanceViolation`  
- `DriftDetected`

---

# 🧪 6. Standards Drift Detector  
Detects drift between standards and the system.

### Drift Types
- **Standard Definition Drift**  
  - standard changed without propagation  
  - standard metadata incorrect  
  - standard superseded but still referenced  

- **Standard Enforcement Drift**  
  - code violates standard  
  - docs violate standard  
  - architecture violates standard  
  - API violates standard  
  - lifecycle violates standard  

- **Standard Propagation Drift**  
  - propagation incomplete  
  - propagation inconsistent  
  - propagation stale  

### Responsibilities
- detect drift  
- classify drift  
- compute impact  
- emit drift events  

### Emits
- `StandardsDriftDetected`  
- `DriftDetected`  
- `MetadataChanged`

This plugs directly into the **Documentation Drift Remediation Engine**.

---

# 🛠️ 7. Standards Remediation Bridge  
Connects standards drift to governed remediation.

### Responsibilities
- map drift → remediation strategies  
- generate StandardsRemediationUnits  
- update standards docs  
- update code linting rules  
- update architecture boundaries  
- update API schemas  
- update documentation templates  
- update lifecycle rules  
- update governance rules (if standard change is intentional)  

### Ordering (governance‑encoded)
1. ADRs  
2. governance rules  
3. standards  
4. architecture  
5. code boundaries  
6. documentation  
7. CI/lifecycle  

Outputs become **ChangePlans** applied via the Execution Agent.

---

# 🧬 8. Standards CI Enforcement Pipeline  
Integrates standards into CI as **constitutional gates**.

### Responsibilities
- run standards validation  
- run standards propagation validation  
- run standards enforcement validation  
- run standards drift detection  
- validate ChangePlans that modify standards  

### Blocks merge if:
- any binding standard violated  
- any required standard violated  
- any propagation failure  
- any drift unresolved  
- any governance violation  

### Warns if:
- informational standards violated  

Standards become **CI‑enforced law**.

# 🧠 Non‑Obvious Insight  
The Standards Integration Layer is not a style guide.  
It is the **institutional standards governance system** that:

- makes standards **executable**  
- makes standards **graph‑encoded**  
- makes standards **enforceable**  
- makes standards **drift‑detectable**  
- makes standards **propagating**  
- makes standards **remediable**  
- makes standards **versioned and superseded**  
- makes standards **first‑class governance artifacts**  

It turns standards from *documents* into **governed, enforceable, living rules**.
